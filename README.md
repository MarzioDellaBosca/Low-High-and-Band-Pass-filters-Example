This project implements a Haskell program and a Prolog program that acquire a finite list of real numbers from the keyboard, representing a signal in the time domain, and apply 
the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to the signal. Subsequently, they request the type of filter (low-pass, high-pass, or band-pass) to be used, the cutoff frequency(ies), and perform 
the filtering in the frequency domain. Finally, they apply the Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) and print the filtered signal in the time domain.
